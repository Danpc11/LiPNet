## [Unreleased]

## [0.2] – 2026-09-20

Methodological and calculator fixes after two rounds of code review.

### Changed
- `data/series.tsv` now holds raw values only, with provenance columns `PVF_basis`, `PVP_basis`, `CVP_basis`, `events_basis` (`reported`, `derived`, `imputed`, `threshold`, `group mean`, `not applicable`) and a column `in_main_analysis`; the stored `zP` and `zF` columns were removed and are recomputed by `src/indices.py`, the single source used by the fit, the plots, the tests and the calculator.
- Groups defined only by a flow cut-off (Vasavada 2014, PVF above and below 190 mL/min/100 g) are excluded from the main analysis, drawn hollow in `series_flow` and reported in sensitivity. Main flow result: 11 groups, Spearman ρ = 0.35, p = 0.29 (13 groups, ρ = 0.23, p = 0.46 when included).
- Sensitivity analysis is now per index: a group is excluded for `zP` only if PVP or CVP is imputed or filled, and for `zF` only if PVF or the donor reference is. `results/sensitivity.tsv` lists all analyses. The pooled logistic fit cannot be repeated without imputed CVP (only Yamada 2008 has fully reported pressures, with no events); this is stated in the README as the main limitation.
- Notes column translated to English and made explicit about every derivation (PVF divided by graft weight, PVP from gradient plus CVP, deaths from survival percentages with the unrounded value).
- Calculator: the normal portocaval gradient is fixed at 5 mmHg (the value the coefficients were fitted on) instead of user-editable; the curve grid extends to `zP` 0.5–8 and the range of the fitted groups (1.43–2.68) is stored so that values outside it are labelled as extrapolation with a band computed for the same `zP`.
- Calculator text ("4 of the 5 groups had no reported CVP") and coefficients are injected by `build_app.py` from the analysis outputs.
- README results updated to the current analysis (intercept −6.40; flow result with and without cut-off groups; per-index sensitivity).

### Added
- `indices.compute()` records every value it fills in (`CVP_filled`, `donor_ref_filled`), counts it as imputed regardless of the label, and raises an error when a label contradicts the data (e.g. a blank CVP marked `reported`).
- Calculator input validation: a blank CVP is taken as 5 mmHg and flagged, an explicit 0 is a measured zero; PVP and CVP must be non-negative; graft weight, GRWR, recipient weight and donor reference must be positive numbers (a blank donor reference falls back to 90 mL/min/100 g and says so); a portal flow of 0 gives `zF = 0`, is labelled "no portal inflow", and the ratio `zP/zF` and its interpretation are omitted.
- Separate labels for pressure (`tagP`: zero or negative gradient, steal risk, window, above window, high) and flow (`tagF`: no inflow, below donor, 1–2×, 2–3×, >3× donor).
- Tests: incomplete edits are caught, cut-off groups are excluded, README figures are checked against `results/`, calculator has no editable gradient and validates inputs. Tests run the full bootstrap so they never leave a short-bootstrap JSON that would alter the built calculator.
- `data/interventions.tsv` (pressure and flow change per inflow-modulation manoeuvre, with source) replaces values hard-coded in `plots.py`.
- `src/model/merge_campaigns.py` to merge per-size campaign outputs; `CITATION.cff` with version, date and concept DOI; `.zenodo.json`; `index.html` redirect for GitHub Pages; `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed
- A blank CVP was read as 0 by the calculator (risk jumped from 13.1% to 49.6% with the default inputs).
- Changing the reference gradient in the calculator invalidated the fitted coefficients.
- Recomputed indices were not the ones used by the correlations and the fit.
- Uncertainty band outside the curve range was taken from the curve end-point instead of the actual `zP`.
- Negative or zero graft weight produced a negative `zF`; donor reference 0 was silently replaced by 90.
- A shared `tag()` labelled a zero pressure gradient as "no portal inflow".
- `plane` and `risk_curve` plots included cut-off groups.
- The token `n/a` in provenance columns was read by pandas as missing; replaced by `not applicable`.
- Unused functions removed from `src/model/network.py` (430 → 244 lines); leftover paper-figure scripts and the derived `data/graph3d_exponents.tsv` removed.

### Removed
- `data/graph3d_exponents.tsv` (exponents are computed on the fly), stored `zP`/`zF` columns, editable gradient field in the calculator.

## [0.1] – 2026-09-20

First public release. Archived as [10.5281/zenodo.22861277](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22861277).

### Added
- Extraction table of 12 published LDLT series (22 groups, 1,026 recipients) with the source table or page for every value.
- Indices `zP = (PVP − CVP)/5` and `zF = graft PVF per 100 g / donor PVF per 100 g`; Spearman correlations with outcome; pooled binomial logistic fit of SFSS on `zP` with 2000-resample bootstrap band.
- 14 stand-alone plots (`src/plots.py`): nomogram, risk curve, series by pressure and by flow, flow–pressure plane, resection, load curve, interventions, 2D and 3D optimal networks, scaling, allometry, shear profile, certificate.
- Perfusion-network model of the liver (`src/model/`): 2D and hemispheric 3D graphs, dissipation-optimal tree at fixed maintenance cost, closed-form scaling and allometric closure, campaign scripts with cached outputs.
- Browser calculator `sfss_calculator.html`, built by `src/build_app.py`.
- `run_all.sh`, tests with GitHub Actions, PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 licence, patient-level table and cohort template.
